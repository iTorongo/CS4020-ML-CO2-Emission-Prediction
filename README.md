CS4020: Carbon Emission Prediction Using Machine Learning.   
This repository has been made as a part of the final project assignment of USN Data Science course CS4020 by Md. Muzibur Rahman and Arnaf Aziz Torongo.

## Introduction

Global warming is one of the critical reasons for climate change. The emission of Carbon dioxide (CO2) by humans is one of many reasons for global warming. If necessary measures are not taken in time, this will cause a devastating impact throughout the world. This project aims to provide a more comprehensive range of country wise CO2 predictions analyzing the time series dataset and applying several machine learning algorithms and techniques.
